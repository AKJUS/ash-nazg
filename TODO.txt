    âœ“ find a nice way to embed make JSX happy with jshint
    - build general layout, header/footer stuff
    - set up ungrid
    - create left menu with various actions
    - some actions require GH login, when that happens prompt for it
    - create repo
    - import repo
    - handle forks (?)
    - handle PR, PR comments, set status
    - add group (can we check that someone is on a GH team? limit to w3c owners or something like that)
    - remove group
    - pump information into Pheme
    - report, list status
    - approve/reject pending users
