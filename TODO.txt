TODO:
    âœ“ find a nice way to embed make JSX happy with jshint
        - we probably want jshint back, too
        - have only one for JSX
        - have both for JS
    - build general layout, header/footer stuff
    - set up ungrid
    - create left menu with various actions
    - some actions require GH login, when that happens prompt for it
    - create repo
    - import repo
    - handle forks (?)
    - handle PR, PR comments, set status
    - add group (can we check that someone is on a GH team? limit to w3c owners or something like that)
    - remove group
    - pump information into Pheme
    - report, list status
    - approve/reject pending users


NEXT:
    - a GHUser store that's interested in gh-login and gh-logout actions
        it also emits when the login box gives it the information it needs
        it has isLoggedIn() that returns true/false
    - this here view needs to render something different dependending on whether the user is
        logged in or not, as an if statement in render()
        it listens to changes on GHUser to know if it needs to show login or UI
    - a bunch of action types for everything (seems slightly ugly but weirdly neater too)
    - always show an affordance to logout once logged in
    - when we show UI, we will need a similar store for what's going on with octokat, but we'll
        get there later
