    ✓ find a nice way to embed make JSX happy with jshint
        ✓ we probably want jshint back, too
        ✓ have only one for JSX
        ✓ have both for JS
    ✓ build general layout, header/footer stuff
    ✓ set up ungrid
    ✓ create left menu with various actions
    ✓ some actions require GH login, when that happens prompt for it
    - create repo
    - import repo
    - handle forks (?)
    - handle PR, PR comments, set status
    - add group (can we check that someone is on a GH team? limit to w3c owners or something like that)
    - remove group
    - pump information into Pheme
    - report, list status
    - approve/reject pending users


NEXT:
    - always show an affordance to logout once logged in
    - when we show UI, we will need a similar store for what's going on with octokat, but we'll
        get there later
